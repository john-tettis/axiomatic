Go to community tab, see what the community has to say. Comment thoughts on quotes. FOllow users that seem to have something deep and real to say.  Have a realization or clarity, and share wisdom. 
 
 ### API Notes
 
 I originally planned to use a quotes API that provided a quote ID, tag list, and category for each quote received from the API. THIs was unfortunately behind a paywall. THe restrictions of this project kept me to free APIs only. Hence zen quotes. Free to use, but significatnly less functionality. No search capability, no tags, categories, or IDS. In  the end, I worked around these limitations, and I truly think that the simplistic design of Axiomatic turned out for to be for the best.
